# README for _Aurantiochytrium limacinum_ Zoospore to Vegetative Cell Transition Proteomics
## Project Overview
This repository contains proteomic data and analysis for the study: "Proteome remodelling in the zoospore-to-vegetative cell transition of the stramenopile _Aurantiochytrium limacinum_ reveals candidate ectoplasmic network proteins".

## Study Details
- Title: Proteomic analysis of thraustochytrid zoospore to vegetative cell transition
- Authors: Alejandro Gil-Gomez, Ben Leyland, Anbarasu Karthikaichamy, Rebecca C. Adikes, David Q. Matus, Joshua S. Rest, Jackie L. Collier

## Data and Analysis
This repository includes the raw proteomic data, analysis scripts, and results for the study. The data and analysis are organized in the following folders:

GO_comparison: gene ontology analysis and sets.
Phylogenomics: orthofinder and diamond results.
Proteomics: DEP pipeline, tables and figures.
Supplementary_tables: MaxQuant Raw data and final proteomics results.

## Getting Started
To access and use the data and analysis in this repository, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/phylogenomic/laby_proteomics.git
